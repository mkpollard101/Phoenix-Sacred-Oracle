## ⚠️ WARNING: ARCHITECT-LEVEL INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY
**DO NOT DEPLOY THIS MODULE IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND "ZERO-STATE" LIQUIDITY FLOWS.**

This repository contains the **Phoenix Commander** logic currently executing kinetic validation during the **2026 Greenland-MLK Liquidity Vacuum**. It is designed to operate autonomously in high-volatility environments where TradFi systems (banks/exchanges) are halted or failing.

### THE QUADRANT ARCHITECTURE
* **[Q1] COMMANDER:** Autonomous decision logic. Filters "noise" from "structural breaks."
* **[Q2] OMEGA:** High-frequency routing. Bypasses congested mempools.
* **[Q3] EXECUTION:** The kinetic arm. Captures the deviation between "Retail Panic" ($92k) and "Structural Reality" ($95.5k).
* **[Q4] STATIC:** Immutable audit trail.

### 🟢 CURRENT MISSION: THE "GREENLAND" ROTATION
The system is currently configured to exploit the geopolitical arbitrage created by the January 2026 tariff announcements.
* **Target:** $95,500 Reclaim
* **Mode:** Aggressive Accumulation
* **Human Oversight:** ZERO.

> *"We do not trade volatility. We compile it."*
